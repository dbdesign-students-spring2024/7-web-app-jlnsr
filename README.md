## Share Planner  
Share Planner, the title of my app, is essentially a visualized 'to-do'  list. It is a simple app that allows users to categorize and organize chores/tasks with ease. At the home page, a user can either login with their credentials or create a new account via the 'sign-up' button. The app.py file ensures that all usernames are unique. Once logged in, a user has access to all their 'to-do' items and has the ability to create new ones. 'To-do' items are color-coded, with five possible categories of chores imaginable; 'school', 'work', 'home', 'outside', 'social'.
